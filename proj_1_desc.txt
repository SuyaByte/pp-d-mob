PRIVACY-PRESERVING DRONE MOBILITY

1. Simulate two simple mobility models: (i) Random Waypoint (RWP) and Privacy-Preserving Random (PPR).

In RWP, a drone chooses a random destination within a 1,000 x 1,000 (m2) network, 2-dimensional network. The drone flies toward the destination. Upon arrival, the drone stays during a pausing time. Then the drone chooses another random destination within the network and flies toward the destination. The drone repeats the same procedure.

In PPR, a drone chooses a random destination within the network. Rather than flying straight to the destination, the drone builds a virtual rectangle with a diagonal starting from its current location to the destination and generates several dummy locations (k) located with the rectangle. Then the drone flies toward the destination through all the dummy locations, e.g., from the closest located dummy location first.

For visualization, use a solid line for the drone path, and mark the drone location every one second interval. For RWP and PPR, mark the drone as ‘*’ (start) and ‘o’ (empty circle), respectively.

2. Input parameters

• Mobility model: 0 for RWP and 1 for PPR
• Velocity: 1 to 5 m/sec
• Pausing time: 0 to 10 secs
• Number of dummy location (k): 2 or 3

3. Run at least twice for each mobility model by changing input parameters. For example, type the following in the command window. For PPR, show the results when k is 2 or 3.

• >> mobility(0, 2, 5, 0) % RWP, 2 m/s, 5 secs pausing time, zero dummy location
• >> mobility(1, 3, 10, 2) % PPR, 3 m/s, 10 secs pausing time, two dummy locations

4. Measure the performance for each mobility model.

• Total flying distance from the base, left and bottom of the network (0, 0)
• Total flying time
